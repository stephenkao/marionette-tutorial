The public/javascripts/app directory contains page applications, which are dedicated modules that have a 1:1 correspondence with each type of page.  For instance, the Le Sir Management Tool has four distinct, browsable pages:

- "List" facet
This is a bird's-eye view of all active projects.

- "Yearbook" facet

- "Project" facet

- "Gantt" facet
